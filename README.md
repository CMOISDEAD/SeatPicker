The Storybook is aviable [here](https://seat-picker.vercel.app/) with the examples and documentation.

Import all the components and the default styles.

```jsx

```

Then create the data matrix with the utility function, you can define reserved seats.
```jsx
  const data = createMatrix3x3({ row: 1, column: 1 });
  const reserved = ["B28", "B29", "B30"]
```
Inside the SeatMapProvider pass all the data to SeatMap component.

```jsx
<SeatMapProvider>
  <SeatMap
    size={data.size}
    cells={data.cells}
    reserved={reserved}
  />
</SeatMapProvider>
```

All example code just looks like.

```jsx
import { createMatrix3x3, SeatMap, SeatMapProvider } from "simple-seat-picker"
import "simple-seat-picker/dist/style.css"

function App() {
  const data = createMatrix3x3({ row: 1, column: 1 });
  const reserved = ["B28", "B29", "B30"]


  return (
    <div>
      <SeatMapProvider>
        <SeatMap
          size={data.size}
          cells={data.cells}
          reserved={reserved}
